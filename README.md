# ankimote

**Ankimote** is an addon that adds remote control functionality to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), the open source flashcards app.

After installing this addon, selecting 'Remote' from the Anki toolbar will start Ankimote and display a QR code and URL directing to the remote that can be opened by any other device on the local network (usually your phone).

The remote component of Ankimote consists of a native app for Android and a web interface for iOS and other platforms.
